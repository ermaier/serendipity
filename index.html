          <p>I plunged my hands into the gooey blob in front of me and grabbed
            with all my strength. I pulled two long, spindly strands out toward
            me. Frowning in concentration, I pulled them over, made a fist, and
            punched the whole mass back into the steel bowl.</p>
          <p>“Meeees Reeeeeevers!” Philippe’s voice reverberated behind my head.
            I jumped about a foot and forgot to let go of the dough. The huge
            bowl spun towards me precariously and was only saved from landing on
            the floor by a sudden grab from Bernie, stationed next to me. I
            flashed her a grateful smile and re-centered the bowl in the middle
            of my counter space.</p>
          <p>“Yes, Monsieur deSouse,” I gasped after I’d gotten my breath back.
            He’d massacred my name - Kay Rivers - but since he was standing
            directly behind me and shouting at my head, no one had any doubt who
            he was aiming for.</p>
          <p>“This is an abomination!” he yelled, and waved his arms toward the
            rest of the class. “Come and see this disaster so you can avoid it
            for yourselves! Come, now!”</p>
          <p>The remaining students in his Master Pastry class obediently
            shuffled over and arranged themselves around my workspace. I gritted
            my teeth and stood back a little. He’d been screaming at mistakes
            for the last two and a half hours, and the four of us were the only
            ones left. He had started out with ten, but that was at the
            beginning of the session. A steady stream of furious bakers
            demanding refunds had occupied the time of John Paul, his assistant,
            pretty much without stopping.</p>
          <p>I wasn’t sure why I was still there. I knew why I started the
            class: I was trying to decide whether to change careers. Philippe
            deSouse was a world-class pastry maker who had recently settled
            himself as Principal Baker at one of the premier luxury resorts in
            Tucson. If I was serious about baking, I couldn’t pass up an
            opportunity to take a class from him.</p>
          <p>His abuse of students and assistants was almost as legendary as his
            pastries. I’d shrugged it off. I can handle criticism, and I wasn’t
            worried about his scathing commentary. I just hadn’t realized he’d
            be delivering it at a deafening volume, his head bent to an inch of
            my face, so close I could almost feel the prickles of his two-day
            unshaven beard. “Miss Rivers!” he said again, only this time he
            tried harder on the pronunciation. “Do you have any idea what you
            are doing?”</p>

        <div class="snippet" id="snip3" style="display:none;">Any other morning, I’d dive into Durga’s observation bay without hesitation, but this is the day before my life begins. I hang back on the concrete meridian and raise the Tanto strapped to my wrist, jabbing the button that ignites the miniature LED beacon. 

As the blue lights glow and a low tone rings out over the water, she rises. Durga’s head is the first thing to emerge from the waves, the brutal lines of her reptilian beak fading into the soft wrinkles that wreathe her huge, round eyes. She lets out a snort that blasts seawater from all three blowholes lined along the ridge of her skull. 

The smell of salt, sea, and carrion washes over me, and I drink it in, letting the familiar aroma drain the nervousness from my body. Everything starts tomorrow, but I have nothing to fear with Durga by my side. 

She raises one massive, clawed foreleg out of the water and slams it down, sending up a spray that plows over the meridian, leaving me drenched and sputtering and regretting hanging back on the barrier. Reckoners may be ruthless killing machines, but they’re downright cheeky when they know they can get away with it. 

When I finish blinking away the brine, I swear I can see a twinkle in her eyes. I snap off the Tanto and pull my respirator up from around my neck, slipping the rubbery mouthpiece between my teeth as I fasten the straps behind my head. My mask comes next, slightly fogged from the warm August air.

Once I’m sure I’ll be able to breathe and see, I take a running leap off the meridian and dive headfirst into the water. 

The ocean swallows me in a rush. The morning light dances through the waves, shrouding Durga’s bulk in glittering beams. With a few short strokes, I draw up to the tip of her beak and grab the edge of her keratin plating. 

Durga blinks once, then lifts her head. 

I crimp my fingers tighter as she raises me up out of the water. She’s horrendously gentle for a beast the size of a football field. Her eyes never leave me. 

“Good old girl,” I murmur against her plating, then let go. The water engulfs me again, and I immediately lunge forward to grab the keratin covering her chest. I rap my knuckles against it twice. As long as I remind her where I am, Durga will be careful not to crush me. 

I dive deeper, running my hands along the knobby, leathery skin between her plates. Most of the other trainers hate getting stuck with morning once-over duty, but it’s always been relaxing for me. Checking over Durga is like exploring an alien planet. As I glide along beneath her belly, I map out her ridges and crevices, the tectonics of muscles working beneath her skin, the subtle shifts of coloring that patch her hide. Her primary genes come from snapping turtles, giving her the wide, bulky body and spiny plated shell, but the length of her limbs and the muddled regions of red and green that swath her skin are reminders of the marine iguana DNA woven into her makeup. 

She’s a big dumb turtle four times the weight of a blue whale, but there’s no denying the elegance of her construction. 

I’m halfway down her left foreleg when it happens. Something pulses through the water, and it takes me a second to realize that Durga just shivered. 

Reckoners don’t shiver.

        <div class="snippet" id="snip4" style="display:none;">The trouble began long before June 9, 1976, when I became aware of
it, but June 9 is the day I remember. It was my twenty-sixth birthday. It
was also the day I met Rufus—the day he called me to him for the first
time.
Kevin and I had not planned to do anything to celebrate my birthday.
We were both too tired for that. On the day before, we had moved from
our apartment in Los Angeles to a house of our own a few miles away in
Altadena. The moving was celebration enough for me. We were still
unpacking—or rather, I was still unpacking. Kevin had stopped when he
got his office in order. Now he was closeted there either loafing or thinking
because I didn’t hear his typewriter. Finally, he came out to the
living room where I was sorting books into one of the big bookcases.
Fiction only. We had so many books, we had to try to keep them in some
kind of order.
“What’s the matter?” I asked him.
“Nothing.” He sat down on the floor near where I was working. “Just
struggling with my own perversity. You know, I had half-a- dozen ideas
for that Christmas story yesterday during the moving.”
“And none now when there’s time to write them down.”
“Not a one.” He picked up a book, opened it, and turned a few pages.
I picked up another book and tapped him on the shoulder with it. When
he looked up, surprised, I put a stack of nonfiction down in front of him.
He stared at it unhappily.
“Hell, why’d I come out here?”
“To get more ideas. After all, they come to you when you’re busy.”
He gave me a look that I knew wasn’t as malevolent as it seemed. He
had the kind of pale, almost colorless eyes that made him seem distant
and angry whether he was or not. He used them to intimidate people.
Strangers. I grinned at him and went back to work. After a moment, he
took the nonfiction to another bookcase and began shelving it.
I bent to push him another box full, then straightened quickly as I
began to feel dizzy, nauseated. The room seemed to blur and darken
around me. I stayed on my feet for a moment holding on to a bookcase
and wondering what was wrong, then finally, I collapsed to my knees. I
heard Kevin make a wordless sound of surprise, heard him ask, “What
happened?”
I raised my head and discovered that I could not focus on him. “Something
is wrong with me,” I gasped.
I heard him move toward me, saw a blur of gray pants and blue shirt.
Then, just before he would have touched me, he vanished.
The house, the books, everything vanished. Suddenly, I was outdoors
kneeling on the ground beneath trees. I was in a green place. I was at the
edge of a woods. Before me was a wide tranquil river, and near the middle
of that river was a child splashing, screaming …
