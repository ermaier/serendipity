          <p>I plunged my hands into the gooey blob in front of me and grabbed
            with all my strength. I pulled two long, spindly strands out toward
            me. Frowning in concentration, I pulled them over, made a fist, and
            punched the whole mass back into the steel bowl.</p>
          <p>“Meeees Reeeeeevers!” Philippe’s voice reverberated behind my head.
            I jumped about a foot and forgot to let go of the dough. The huge
            bowl spun towards me precariously and was only saved from landing on
            the floor by a sudden grab from Bernie, stationed next to me. I
            flashed her a grateful smile and re-centered the bowl in the middle
            of my counter space.</p>
          <p>“Yes, Monsieur deSouse,” I gasped after I’d gotten my breath back.
            He’d massacred my name - Kay Rivers - but since he was standing
            directly behind me and shouting at my head, no one had any doubt who
            he was aiming for.</p>
          <p>“This is an abomination!” he yelled, and waved his arms toward the
            rest of the class. “Come and see this disaster so you can avoid it
            for yourselves! Come, now!”</p>
          <p>The remaining students in his Master Pastry class obediently
            shuffled over and arranged themselves around my workspace. I gritted
            my teeth and stood back a little. He’d been screaming at mistakes
            for the last two and a half hours, and the four of us were the only
            ones left. He had started out with ten, but that was at the
            beginning of the session. A steady stream of furious bakers
            demanding refunds had occupied the time of John Paul, his assistant,
            pretty much without stopping.</p>
          <p>I wasn’t sure why I was still there. I knew why I started the
            class: I was trying to decide whether to change careers. Philippe
            deSouse was a world-class pastry maker who had recently settled
            himself as Principal Baker at one of the premier luxury resorts in
            Tucson. If I was serious about baking, I couldn’t pass up an
            opportunity to take a class from him.</p>
          <p>His abuse of students and assistants was almost as legendary as his
            pastries. I’d shrugged it off. I can handle criticism, and I wasn’t
            worried about his scathing commentary. I just hadn’t realized he’d
            be delivering it at a deafening volume, his head bent to an inch of
            my face, so close I could almost feel the prickles of his two-day
            unshaven beard. “Miss Rivers!” he said again, only this time he
            tried harder on the pronunciation. “Do you have any idea what you
            are doing?”</p>

        <div class="snippet" id="snip3" style="display:none;">
          <p>Any other morning, I’d dive into Durga’s observation bay without
            hesitation, but this is the day before my life begins. I hang back
            on the concrete meridian and raise the Tanto strapped to my wrist,
            jabbing the button that ignites the miniature LED beacon. </p>
          <p>As the blue lights glow and a low tone rings out over the water,
            she rises. Durga’s head is the first thing to emerge from the waves,
            the brutal lines of her reptilian beak fading into the soft wrinkles
            that wreathe her huge, round eyes. She lets out a snort that blasts
            seawater from all three blowholes lined along the ridge of her
            skull. </p>
          <p>The smell of salt, sea, and carrion washes over me, and I drink it
            in, letting the familiar aroma drain the nervousness from my body.
            Everything starts tomorrow, but I have nothing to fear with Durga by
            my side. </p>
          <p>She raises one massive, clawed foreleg out of the water and slams
            it down, sending up a spray that plows over the meridian, leaving me
            drenched and sputtering and regretting hanging back on the barrier.
            Reckoners may be ruthless killing machines, but they’re downright
            cheeky when they know they can get away with it. </p>
          <p>When I finish blinking away the brine, I swear I can see a twinkle
            in her eyes. I snap off the Tanto and pull my respirator up from
            around my neck, slipping the rubbery mouthpiece between my teeth as
            I fasten the straps behind my head. My mask comes next, slightly
            fogged from the warm August air.</p>
          <p>Once I’m sure I’ll be able to breathe and see, I take a running
            leap off the meridian and dive headfirst into the water. </p>
          <p>The ocean swallows me in a rush. The morning light dances through
            the waves, shrouding Durga’s bulk in glittering beams. With a few
            short strokes, I draw up to the tip of her beak and grab the edge of
            her keratin plating. </p>
          <p>Durga blinks once, then lifts her head.</p>
          <p>I crimp my fingers tighter as she raises me up out of the water.
            She’s horrendously gentle for a beast the size of a football field.
            Her eyes never leave me. </p>
          <p>“Good old girl,” I murmur against her plating, then let go. The
            water engulfs me again, and I immediately lunge forward to grab the
            keratin covering her chest. I rap my knuckles against it twice. As
            long as I remind her where I am, Durga will be careful not to crush
            me.</p>
          <p>I dive deeper, running my hands along the knobby, leathery skin
            between her plates. Most of the other trainers hate getting stuck
            with morning once-over duty, but it’s always been relaxing for me.
            Checking over Durga is like exploring an alien planet. As I glide
            along beneath her belly, I map out her ridges and crevices, the
            tectonics of muscles working beneath her skin, the subtle shifts of
            coloring that patch her hide. Her primary genes come from snapping
            turtles, giving her the wide, bulky body and spiny plated shell, but
            the length of her limbs and the muddled regions of red and green
            that swath her skin are reminders of the marine iguana DNA woven
            into her makeup. </p>
          <p>She’s a big dumb turtle four times the weight of a blue whale, but
            there’s no denying the elegance of her construction. </p>
          <p>I’m halfway down her left foreleg when it happens. Something pulses
            through the water, and it takes me a second to realize that Durga
            just shivered. </p>
          <p>Reckoners don’t shiver.</p>

          <p>The trouble began long before June 9, 1976, when I became aware of
            it, but June 9 is the day I remember. It was my twenty-sixth
            birthday. It
            was also the day I met Rufus—the day he called me to him for the
            first time.</p>
          <p>Kevin and I had not planned to do anything to celebrate my
            birthday.
            We were both too tired for that. On the day before, we had moved
            from
            our apartment in Los Angeles to a house of our own a few miles away
            in
            Altadena. The moving was celebration enough for me. We were still
            unpacking—or rather, I was still unpacking. Kevin had stopped when
            he
            got his office in order. Now he was closeted there either loafing or
            thinking
            because I didn’t hear his typewriter. Finally, he came out to the
            living room where I was sorting books into one of the big bookcases.
            Fiction only. We had so many books, we had to try to keep them in
            some kind of order.</p>
          <p>“What’s the matter?” I asked him.</p>
          <p>“Nothing.” He sat down on the floor near where I was working. “Just
            struggling with my own perversity. You know, I had half-a- dozen
            ideas for that Christmas story yesterday during the moving.”</p>
          <p>“And none now when there’s time to write them down.”</p>
          <p>“Not a one.” He picked up a book, opened it, and turned a few
            pages.</p>
          <p>I picked up another book and tapped him on the shoulder with it.
            When
            he looked up, surprised, I put a stack of nonfiction down in front
            of him. He stared at it unhappily.</p>
          <p>“Hell, why’d I come out here?”</p>
          <p>“To get more ideas. After all, they come to you when you’re busy.”</p>
          <p>He gave me a look that I knew wasn’t as malevolent as it seemed. He
            had the kind of pale, almost colorless eyes that made him seem
            distant
            and angry whether he was or not. He used them to intimidate people.
            Strangers. I grinned at him and went back to work. After a moment,
            he
            took the nonfiction to another bookcase and began shelving it.
            I bent to push him another box full, then straightened quickly as I
            began to feel dizzy, nauseated. The room seemed to blur and darken
            around me. I stayed on my feet for a moment holding on to a bookcase
            and wondering what was wrong, then finally, I collapsed to my knees.
            I
            heard Kevin make a wordless sound of surprise, heard him ask, “What
            happened?”</p>
          <p>I raised my head and discovered that I could not focus on him.
            “Something is wrong with me,” I gasped.</p>
          <p>I heard him move toward me, saw a blur of gray pants and blue
            shirt. Then, just before he would have touched me, he vanished.</p>
          <p>The house, the books, everything vanished. Suddenly, I was outdoors
            kneeling on the ground beneath trees. I was in a green place. I was
            at the
            edge of a woods. Before me was a wide tranquil river, and near the
            middle of that river was a child splashing, screaming …</p>

        <div class="snippet" id="snip5" style="display:none;">Practicing surgery
          on the dead
          <p>The human head is of the same approximate size and weight as a
            roaster
            chicken. I have never before had occasion to make the comparison,
            for
            never before today have I seen ahead in a roasting pan. But here are
            forty
            of them, one per pan, resting face up on what looks to be a small
            pet food
            bowl. The heads are for plastic surgeons, two per head, to practice
            on. I'm
            observing a facial anatomy and face-lift refresher course, sponsored
            by a southern university medical center and led by a half dozen of
            America's most sought after face lifters.</p>
          <p>The heads have been put in roasting pans which are of the
            disposable
            aluminum variety for the same reason chickens are put in roasting
            pans: to catch the drippings. Surgery, even surgery upon the dead,
            is a
            tidy, orderly affair. Forty folding utility tables have been draped
            in
            lavender plastic cloths, and a roasting pan is centered on each.
            Skin
            hooks and retractors are set out with the pleasing precision of
            restaurant
            cutlery. The whole thing has the look of a catered reception. I
            mention to
            the young woman whose job it was to set up the seminar this morning
            that the lavender gives the room a cheery sort of Easter party
            feeling. Her
            name is Theresa. She replies that lavender was chosen because it's a
            soothing color.</p>
          <p>hooks and retractors are set out with the pleasing precision of

            the young woman whose job it was to set up the seminar this morning

            feeling. Her name is Theresa. She replies that lavender was chosen
            because it's a
            soothing color. It surprises me to hear that men and women who spend
            their days pruning eyelids and vacuuming fat would require anything
            in the way of
            soothing, but severed heads can be upsetting even to professionals.
            Especially fresh ones ("fresh" here meaning unembalmed). The forty
            heads are from people who have died in the past few days and, as
            such, still look very much the way they looked while those people
            were alive. (Embalming hardens tissues, making the structures less
            pliable and the surgery experience less reflective of an actual
            operation.)</p>
          <p>For the moment, you can't see the faces. They've been draped with
            white
            cloths, pending the arrival of the surgeons. When you first enter
            the room, you see only the tops of the heads, which are shaved down
            to stubble. You could be looking at rows of old men reclining in
            barber chairs with hot towels on their faces. The situation only
            starts to become dire when you make your way down the rows. Now you
            see stumps, and the stumps are not covered. They are bloody and
            rough. I was picturing something cleanly sliced, like the edge of a
            deli ham. I look at the heads, and then I look at the lavender
            tablecloths. Horrify me, soothe me, horrify me.</p>
          <p>They are also very short, these stumps. If it were my job to cut
            the heads off bodies, I would leave the neck and cap the gore
            somehow. These heads appear to have been lopped off just below the
            chin, as though the cadaver had been wearing a turtleneck and the
            decapitator hadn't wished to damage the fabric. I find myself
            wondering whose handiwork this is.</p>
          <p>"Theresa?" She is distributing dissection guides to the tables,
            humming quietly as she works.</p>
          <p>"Mm?"</p>
          <p>"Who cuts off the heads?"</p>
          <p>Theresa answers that the heads are sawed off in the room across the
            hall,
            by a woman named Yvonne. I wonder out loud whether this particular
            aspect of Yvonne's job bothers her. Likewise Theresa. It was Theresa
            who brought the heads in and set them up on their little stands. I
            ask her about this. "What I do is, I think of them as wax."</p>
          <p>Theresa is practicing a time honored coping method:
            objectification. For
            those who must deal with human corpses regularly, it is easier (and,
            I suppose, more accurate) to think of them as objects, not people.
            For most
            physicians, objectification is mastered their first year of medical
            school, in
            the gross anatomy lab, or "gross lab," as it is casually and
            somewhat aptly known. To help depersonalize the human form that
            students will be expected to sink knives into and eviscerate,
            anatomy lab personnel often swathe the cadavers in gauze and
            encourage students to unwrap as they go, part by part.</p>
          <p>The problem with cadavers is that they look so much like people.
            It's the
            reason most of us prefer a pork chop to a slice of whole suckling
            pig. It's
            the reason we say "pork" and "beef" instead of "pig" and "cow."
            Dissection
            and surgical instruction, like meat eating, require a carefully
            maintained set of illusions and denial. Physicians and anatomy
            students must learn to think of cadavers as wholly unrelated to the
            people they once were. "Dissection," writes historian Ruth
            Richardson in Death, Dissection, and the Destitute, " requires in
            its practitioners the effective suspension or suppression of many
            normal physical and emotional responses to the wilful mutilation of
            the body of another human being." Heads or more to the point, faces
            are especially unsettling. At the University of California, San
            Francisco, in whose medical school anatomy lab I would soon spend an
            afternoon, the head and hands are often left wrapped until their
            dissection comes up on the syllabus. "So it's not so intense," one
            student would later tell me. "Because that's what you see of a
            person."</p>
          <p>The surgeons are beginning to gather in the hallway outside the
            lab,
            filling out paperwork and chatting volubly. I go out to watch them.
            Or to not watch the heads, I'm not sure which.</p>

        <div class="snippet" id="snip6" style="display:none;"><p>Looking at Terayama's stage is like looking into a box.  The lid has been removed and one peers down into it, as though from a height.  What one sees had been hidden.  Now it is disclosed. </p>

<p>There sits the bad mother in her dark corner; there is the son, groping as though blind, trying to escape; there is the androgynous young girl, taunting or helping; and there is the other man – half butler, half elder, brother, usually bald. </p>

<p>These creatures live in the depths of the box, an unvarying cast whatever the name of the play.  They are surrounded by – at times half hidden under – the décor:  Taisho-period prints, old Japanese flags, the Victor dog, school uniforms, faded photos, ball gowns, a sword or two; relics of prewar Japan. </p>

<p>A prewar Japan imagined, but Terayama was himself too young to remember any of it.  What he remembered was wartime Aomori, the far north, the snow, the family movie theater, a world of black and white where he grew up. </p>

<p>As a child he took the tickets, swept up afterward, and sprinkled water to keep down the dust.  His lair was behind the screen, a tangle of canvas flats, old stage kimono, into which he curled and gazed up the giants, backward, hanging over him as he lay small in the darkness. </p>

<p>We, likewise, gaze now into the miniature, private, magic world that is his theater, where the same drama is endlessly performed.  It is an expressionist world, reality seen through other eyes, filtered through another mind, a private mythology.  And, as in all expressionist theater, the system is closed; it can be compulsive, claustrophobic. </p>

<p>Terayama's is a world entirely visual.   A deaf man could understand it, but not a blind one.   It is theater for the eyes, not for the ears. </p>

<p>To speak with Teramaya was to become aware of his gaze.  It was the candid stare of a child.  The young are all eyes – they have to be.   They know nothing and seeing is their education.   Terayama's eyes were like windows behind which he lurked. </p>

<p>Yes, lurked.  Though the gaze was direct, there was always a sense of constant, guarded assessment.  One felt he was rearranging what he saw even as he looked upon it.   It is natural that a director of a stage and screen be manipulative, but Terayama gave the impression that he was continually manipulating, that there was no time when he wasn't. </p>

<p>Yet the directions that seemed to emanate from him were too private to be other than ambivalent.  It was not an order the director was giving but a suggestion.  One had to divine for oneself what he really meant, what he actually wanted, uncertain that he even knew himself.  One sensed too that he was judging, not for any professional reason  - will he do in the part? is he being honest?  - but, for something more personal:  do I like him? does he like me?  This he seemed to suggest as he gazed out at you from his secret place, his lair. </p>

<p>Until wasted by illness, Terayama, given to turtleneck sweaters – those emblems of security – had the round face, the pudgy body, large palms, and short fingers of a grown child.  And, like a child, he kept in tact the wonders of his imagination.  These he put on film; on the stage:  odd, esoteric, often very beautiful images, variations on his central myth, his own childhood.  He took everything, assigned parts, animated lives.  Yet the gaze from the caves in his face remained guarded, vulnerable. </p>

<p>Yes, vulnerable.  It was this gaze that killed him.  It happened in this fashion:  directed outward onto stage or film the gaze is called visual imagination; directed outward onto life itself it is called voyeurism. </p>

<p>That Terayama liked to look is central to his person.  He liked to sit in the dark and look at the giant figures, the adults, in their brightly lit space.  Everyone knew this.  It seemed natural. </p>

<p>Not, however, to the police, and along with them the journalists and their magazines and their newspapers.  The law had bothered Terayama before – nudity on the stage forbidden, theater in the streets banned.  So had the press, hypocritically scandalized by the directness of Terayama's reconstruction of an amoral childhood which all of us once knew and some of us remember. </p>

<p>Heretofore, Terayama had paid little attention, had gone on with his life and work.  Now, however, a common voyeur, caught peeping into privacy – bedroom, bathroom, kitchen? - he was was scolded by the law and pilliored by the press. </p>

<p>Not for the first time.  But, now, for the last.  Before, he had gone abroad with his troupe, or had somehow weathered the local storm.  But this one was massive.  Everyone now knew – and one can imagine how this phrase must have been echoed and rebounded in the mind of a vulnerable man, a man so vulnerable that he had to secretly revisit the scenes of his childhood this way. </p>

<p>One would have liked it had the artist hit back, or better, paid no heed.  He was, after all, in addition to being a well-known director, one of Japan's finest modern poets.  But that is not how artists are made.  It is their very sensitivity that makes them artists.  They cannot be expected to hold their own.  And so Terayama became ill – illness though real, always became a refuge with him. </p>

<p>An old illness, cirrhosis – a friend from childhood – had forced him out of the university, and now it forced him out of life.  This hidden degeneration silently consumed him.  The childlike plumpness disappeared, the full cheeks hollowed.  Yet the gaze, questioning, rarely answering, remained to the end. </p>

<p>Terayama, child magician, dead at forty-seven.  Did no one see the connection between his work and his death?  No, no one did.  The press, having hounded him, was respectful.  Voyeurism was not mentioned in the obituaries. </p>

<p>But that is just where it ought to have been.  It was the glorious voyeurism of an artist who had the imagination to will a secret life open to the public, to remove the lid, so that fascinated, we can gaze inside.  It was the splendid, single-minded need to truly see, to experience through sight alone, and then reveal the depths within. </p>
